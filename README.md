# What is cat? What is dog? Here we will find answers
cat_dog_cnn and cat_dog_cnn2.0 are a couple of simple exploratory attempts at building a classification CNN model that can tell the difference between a cat and a dog. I recommend starting with 2.0.

## Requirements
-jupyter lab 4.3.5
-tensorflow 2.10.0
-matplotlib 3.10.0
