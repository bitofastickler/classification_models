# What is cat? What is dog? Here we will find answers
cat_dog_cnn and cat_dog_cnn2.0 are a couple of simple exploratory attempts at building a classification CNN model that can tell the difference between a cat and a dog. I recommend starting with 2.0.

Keras API documentation has an excellent guide on making a very similar model from scratch. Read it and improve on what you find here - https://keras.io/examples/vision/image_classification_from_scratch/

## Requirements:

  - jupyter lab 4.3.5
  - tensorflow 2.10.0
  - matplotlib 3.10.0
